2	 System	            Confirms the ticket purchase and stores the event details in the database.
3	 System	            Sends a ticket confirmation notification to the user via email or app.
4	 System	            Checks the event date and schedules a reminder notification.
5	 System	            Sends an event reminder notification before the event starts (e.g., 24 hours before).
6 	 User	            Receives the notification and can review the event details.
8. Alternate Flows
A1: User has disabled notifications
