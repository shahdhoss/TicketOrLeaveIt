3	 System	            Sends a ticket confirmation notification to the user via email or app.
4	 System	            Checks the event date and schedules a reminder notification.
5	 System	            Sends an event reminder notification before the event starts (e.g., 24 hours before).
6 	 User	            Receives the notification and can review the event details.
8. Alternate Flows
A1: User has disabled notifications

The system does not send notifications but logs the event in the userâ€™s history.
A2: Notification delivery fails

The system retries sending the notification.
If it still fails, the system logs an error and alerts the admin.
9. Postconditions (Final Outcome)
The user receives notifications at the right time.
The system logs the notification status (sent, failed, etc.).
If the user interacts with the notification, they are redirected to the event details page
